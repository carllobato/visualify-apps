/**
 * Access summary (aligned with RLS, 20250328_project_members + editor invite migration):
 * - Table owner → full project + content + members (roles, remove, invite).
 * - project_members.owner → same as table owner for app checks.
 * - project_members.editor → edit project row + risks/snapshots; may invite members (not change roles / remove).
 * - project_members.viewer → read-only project + risks.
 * - No member row but portfolio access → edit risks/snapshots only (not project row).
